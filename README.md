# IRCMachine -- Python IRC Bot
IRCMachine is my own Python (2.7) IRC bot made to help with development related channels.
It's based on [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/) and [irc](https://bitbucket.org/jaraco/irc) libs.

[Todo list is here.](https://github.com/s0r00t/IRCMachine/issues/1)

## Installation
After cloning, run those commands (you may need admin rights to run those) :
>pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
First, you must configure the bot via ircmachine.json. [Check the wiki for help](https://github.com/s0r00t/IRCMachine/wiki/Configuration-file).
Then, run main.py with your favourite interpreter :
>python main.py

## Commands
[Check this wiki page for commands list.](https://github.com/s0r00t/IRCMachine/wiki/Commands-list)
Soon enough, I'll write a small doc on how to write your own commands :)
